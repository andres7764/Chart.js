Installation
Chart.js can be installed via npm or bower. It is recommended to get Chart.js this way.

## npm

```bash
npm install chart.js --save
```

## Bower

```bash
bower install chart.js --save
```

## CDN
or just use these [Chart.js CDN](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/Chart.js) links.


## Github
You can download the latest version of [Chart.js on GitHub](https://github.com/chartjs/Chart.js/releases/latest).

If you download or clone the repository, you must [build](../developers/building.md#building-chartjs) Chart.js to generate the dist files. Chart.js no longer comes with prebuilt release versions, so an alternative option to downloading the repo is **strongly** advised.
