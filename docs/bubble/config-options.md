# Config Options

The bubble chart has no unique configuration options. To configure options common to all of the bubbles, the [point element options](../elements/point.md#point-configuration) are used.

# Default Options

We can also change the default values for the Bubble chart type. Doing so will give all bubble charts created after this point the new defaults. The default configuration for the bubble chart can be accessed at `Chart.defaults.bubble`.
