# Contributing

New contributions to the library are welcome, but we ask that you please follow these guidelines:

- Use tabs for indentation, not spaces.
- Only change the individual files in `/src`.
- Check that your code will pass `eslint` code standards, `gulp lint` will run this for you.
- Check that your code will pass tests, `gulp test` will run tests for you.
- Keep pull requests concise, and document new functionality in the relevant `.md` file.
- Consider whether your changes are useful for all users, or if creating a Chart.js plugin would be more appropriate.
